# Java Gamedev Resources

An archive of the old java-gaming.org resources section. It seemed like quite a useful resource, but since they switched the forum software, the section disappeared. The resources may be outdated, but I'm sure many are still useful.

If you want to contribute, create an issue or pull request, and I'll check it out. If the resource seems good, I'll probably add it.
